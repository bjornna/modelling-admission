# Modelling-admission

This is a collection of archetypes used in the early era of DIPS Arena and openEHR. They where developed back in 2014 to cover the needs at the acute ward at Oslo University Hospital. The models have been used since then. There are some interest from other hospitals in Norway to re-use the solution. Thus this repo to have a "2022-look" at the modelling patterns.
